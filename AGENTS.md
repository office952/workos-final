# WorkOS Final — agent notes

WorkOS Final is a clean reconstruction of the product operating system.
It is not a cleanup or fork of previous WorkOS repositories.

## Current position

PHASE 0 — Repository Foundation.

Do not implement the next product phase without an explicit Owner GO.

## Working rules

- E2E first. A green unit test is not enough. A feature is done when source of truth, contract, backend, API, UI projection, operator interaction, runtime, and tests stay coherent.
- Current WorkOS and other previous repos are read-only reference/evidence. Do not write there. Do not copy architecture or wholesale code.
- UI may code experience. UI must not code business truth: fields, materials, formulas, pricing, readiness, statuses, totals, or Product Truth.
- Operator-facing UI is in Romanian. Internal code and contracts may stay in English.
- Modular product law: an unselected module is silent. A selected module is independently validatable and calculable. Complete product is composition of the same contracts. No hidden parallel calculators.
- SVG Analyzer is a separate application. Its output is evidence/proposal, not final truth, until an operator confirms it.
- Owner gates: no business DB, migrations, seeds, or destructive data work without Owner GO.
- Runtime is required. Do not claim PASS from mocks, screenshots, or hardcoded UI states.
- Keep a persistent worklog under `docs/worklog/`.
- Default: one implementation owner. No parallel implementation agents or speculative architecture.

## Bootstrap proof

The current app only proves that the web talks to a real `GET /api/health` and shows the result in Romanian.
